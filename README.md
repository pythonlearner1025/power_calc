# Sample Size Computation

This repository provides a Python script to compute required sample sizes for specific metrics (e.g., total mobility, sleep duration, etc.) at 70%, 80%, and 90% power.  

## Steps

1. **Floor Sample Sizes**: For each endpoint, we set the current \(n\) for WT (wild type) and mutant to the minimum of the two reported sample sizes.  
2. **Approximate \(t\)-Value**: Use the two-sided \(p\)-value and degrees of freedom (\(df = n_{\text{normal}} + n_{\text{mutant}} - 2\)) to approximate the observed \(t\)-statistic via `scipy.stats.t.ppf()`.  
3. **Compute Pooled SD**: Derive the pooled standard deviation (\(\sigma\)) using  
   \[
     \sigma = \frac{\delta}{t} \sqrt{\frac{n}{2}} 
   \]
   where \(\delta\) is the mean difference, and \(n\) is the (floored) current sample size in each group.  
4. **Compute Required \(n\)**: Use a \(z\)-based formula for power to find new sample sizes per group for 70%, 80%, and 90% power:  
   \[
     n_{\text{per group}} 
       = 2 \left(\frac{z_{\alpha/2} + z_{\text{power}}}{\delta / \sigma}\right)^2.
   \]
5. **Output**: Print a final table containing each metricâ€™s: mean difference, \(p\)-value, current sample sizes, exact \(t\), pooled SD, and required sample sizes for 70%, 80%, and 90% power.

## Assumptions

- Sample sizes for each endpoint are floored to \(\min(n_{\text{WT}}, n_{\text{mutant}})\).  
- Pooled SD is used for the standard deviation.
